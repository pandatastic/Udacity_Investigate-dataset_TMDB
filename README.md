## Conclusion
Based on the analysis of most highly liked movies. If a movies has been highly liked, meaning given really great average votes, it's highly likely that it is either a documentary, war, animation or western movie, with Martin Scorsese or Robert Zimickis as the director, featuring either Tom Hanks, Bradd Pitt, Denzel Washington or Robert De Niro. Although these specific combinations does not exisit, there would be people who are interested to see it for sure.

As far as the financial analysis goes, for a movie to be financial succesful (having higher than average gross profit), that movie should be animation, adventure or family movie, but absolutely not a foregin movie. With Steven Spielberg directring it and staring Harrison Ford.
